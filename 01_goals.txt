Class_ID:
OreClusterJsonConfig: 006

Requirements
---

1. Add Config
---

- Add configBase class to serve as base for different kinds of configs
- Add sample configs
- Let aider simplify sample configs 


2. Aider Work
---

- Added CServer, Client and CCommon files
- Added COreClusters and sample configuration
- Added AllConfigs class to read in configs from all sources

- Removed all create variables from config classes
- Added configString and configList types to  ConfigBases array

3. Get Configs to Work and Minecraft to compile again
---

- Ensured AllConfigs was being registered in Main function
- Fixed issue where Config was subscribing to config load without loading any data and causing crashes

4. Get Arbitrary array configs to work
---

- 

5.
---

- Added defaultConfig and oreConfigs to RealTimeConfig class
- Initialized real time properties in configModel class
- Added subseed for configuration
- Added list of default valid ore cluster blocks
- Added validation for config values upon deserialization
- Addded ConfigModelBase and Moved validation core functionality there

6.
---

- Tested adding custom toml file succesfully
- For Default configs, these cannot be set until the user starts the world
- fine tuned property names and validation issues, added min and max to ConfigBase class


7.
---
  - build OreClusterManager Class and determine its role
  - test OreClusterManager for determining cluster location and parameters
  - build OreClusterChunkEditor for handling real time edits to chunks
  - 

8. Add OreClusterCalculator to calculate Chunk positions and values
---

 - Added handling for world seed, subscribing to server start event
 - Ore cluster chunks will be normally distributed according to their spawn rate
and their Standard deviation is determined by {mean / (log2(mean) * 2)}
 - RealTimeConfig keeps track of WORLD_SPAWN
 - NOTE validate STD_DIST formula for error values
 - Added HolyBucketsUtility class for static utility methods like chunk distances and ids
 - NOTE validate min/max chunk dist formulas on startup


9. Simple commit
---

	- Cleaned up validation functions

13.
---

	- Realized that OreClusterManger needs to be an instance class in order to support multiple worlds, will address later
	- Added thread support to OreClusterManager
	- Need to resolve difficult issue with overlapping ore areas

14.
---

	- Address "getBatchedChunkList" not producing correct amount of chunkIds
	- 

15.
---
	- Added logId to all printable console log building statements
	- Added logId and classId values to all logging statements in actionable classes
	- fixed bug in MangedChunk.java that failed to check for null value when combining maps

16.
---
	- Ensure chunk generation works outside of 256x256 area
	- Ensure we can write chunk data to file
	- write chunk data to file based on world name
	- write chunk data to file based on dimension
	-

17.
---

Dependencies are always an issue:

// Add runtime dependencies to jar
jarJar.fromRuntimeConfiguration()

jarJar {
    // Include or exclude dependencies here from runtime configuration
    dependencies {
        include(dependency("org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc:3.46.1.0"))
    }
}

18.
---

	- Test if chunkloading works in the nether		X Works
	- Test if chunkloading works in the end			X Works
	- Add lastBlockChecked field to ManagedOreClusterChunk - NO, we can just keep it in RAM and re-clean it if it exceeds max time
	- Added special exclude HashSets to loggerbase to deal with logging message overflow

19.
---

	- handleChunkCleaning checks every block and adds potential cluster blocks to a map
	- added workerThreadCleanClusters that cleans determined clusters
	- Need to set reference to ManagedOreChunkCluster in ManagedChunk after determining the cluster


20.
---

	- Test code still compiles
        - Convert Section Pos to correct world pos for block state replacement
        - Convert replacement blocks to actual blocks
        - Check error handling if block state setting fails


21.
---


		- create not terrible JSON defaultConfig for multiple ores
		- test config works for different ores with different configurations
		- perform speed and accuracy chunk building test by flying with elytra

22.
---

	- Moved static OreClustersManager Hashmap to OreClustersAndRegenMain
	- Registered world unload method to general utility, so OreClusters should shutdown its threads when world unloads
		- shutdown logic needs to be more thorough, and also with startup
	- Removed reference to levelChunk from ManagedOreClusterChunk so only reference exists within managed chunk
	- Gold blocks are not generating anymore, for whatever reason
	- level.setBlock yielded IllegalAccess exception on level.setBlockState()
	- reworked getStaticInstance methods in IManagedChunkData
	- Added sampling to logEntry builder
	- Fixed null pointer exception in chunkCleaning method regarding clusterTypes
	- Fixed null pointer error when parent ManagedChunk was returned as null
	- Fixed Index OOB error when gaussian returned negative value.
	- reworked determinedClusters into chunkPendingCleaning queue

23.
---

	- Created AllConfigs class in holyBucketsFoundation to support configs in foundations library mod
	- Created CFoundation class to support implementation config types and support
	- Created CServer class to establish CFoundation as server side configurations
	- Registed mod context under OreClustersMain because foundations doesnt have a main yet



24.
---

	- Added DataStore class to store ModSavedData objects
	- Added ModSavedData class to store Mod Saved data mapping mod_id to an arbitrary JSON object
	- Reworked HBUtil loadJsonConfigs function to accept File instead of level object
	- Renamed HBUtility to HBUtil for brevity
	- added json support for reading json configs in and out for DataStore


25.  
---  

	- Added event registrar class
	- Removed registration elements from config class, renamed to GeneralConfig class

26.  
---  
	- cleaned up datastore, added worldSave and levelSave Objects
	- DataStore reads LevelSave, WorldSave, and ModSave data properties out of file
	- We can read initialized chunks out of the configs
	- Fixed error where deserialization was not occuring due to blockStateUpdates not being parsed correctly
	- Changed delimitter for blockStateUpdates to '=' from ':' which is used for Minecraft block groups
	- Fixed error where blockStateUpdates was null on deserialization
	- Updated MANAGED_SUBCLASSES to take a supplier function so the same Managed Subclass chunk was not used to init all new subclasses. A new one is supplied each call.
	- Removed halt on editManagedChunk that cause the function to auto return
	- Commented out loggers 002025 and 002028
	- Fixed issue with DataStore where it did not write out properties on first world load
	- Altered ChunkUtils.getLevelChunk function to check getChunkNow() before getChunk(... forceLoad==true) because the latter caused circular dependency on world load



	- Datastore logs error and handles cases here file is empty or returns invalid JSON

	- test file creation, serialization and location tomorrow
	- 

	- Attempt to add oreConfig data and serialize
	- ID levels with dimension names
	- ID save files with world Folder, levelData
	- Create static hashset of LoadedIds
	-


		- Add an indicator to the param to NOT generate clusters

		- port mod to remote server and test for accuracy and ability
		- find out how to get chunkUnload to trigger

		- write chunkBuildingAlgorithm, just build a big cube
		- Will need to load adjacent chunks when building cluster to feel natural
		- Or just add them to the other cchunks queue, that may be tough

		- Determine "ticksLastRefreshed" parameter on ManagedOreClusterChunk
		- tickLastRefreshed < LAST_REGEN_TICK then do a refresh, set tickLastRefreshed to LAST_REGEN_TICK
		- when currentGameTick > NEXT_REGEN_TICK, set LAST_REGEN_TICK == NEXT_REGEN_TICK
			- calculate NEXT_REGEN_TICK += PERIOD_LENGTH_TICKS

	      - Find way to check if chunk gets unloaded
		-  THREADS CONTINUE TO RUN AFTER WORLD IS SHUTDOWN, NEEDS TO QUIT

		


	Touchups:
	- Determine Max Size/Lifetime of Managed Chunk in RAM
	- Add level distinguisher in TOML
	- Add level JSON property to ore configuration
	- Alter ManagedOreClusterChunk sourcing algorithm to select valid Regenerating ores by cluster
	- Move Particular Ore configuration JSON to its own config file and folder
	- Set TOML config file to read file name where JSON config is stored

			

	- Ore cleaning

	Cluster Building
	- Cluster point determination
	- Cluster building (shape, point)
	- Cluster generating (in world)
	- Cluster Re-generating
