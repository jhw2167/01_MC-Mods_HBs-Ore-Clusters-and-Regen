Requirements
---

1. Add Config
---

- Add configBase class to serve as base for different kinds of configs
- Add sample configs
- Let aider simplify sample configs 


2. Aider Work
---

- Added CServer, Client and CCommon files
- Added COreClusters and sample configuration
- Added AllConfigs class to read in configs from all sources

- Removed all create variables from config classes
- Added configString and configList types to  ConfigBases array

3. Get Configs to Work and Minecraft to compile again
---

- Ensured AllConfigs was being registered in Main function
- Fixed issue where Config was subscribing to config load without loading any data and causing crashes

4. Get Arbitrary array configs to work
---

- 

5.
---

- Added defaultConfig and oreConfigs to RealTimeConfig class
- Initialized real time properties in configModel class
- Added subseed for configuration
- Added list of default valid ore cluster blocks
- Added validation for config values upon deserialization
- Addded ConfigModelBase and Moved validation core functionality there

6.
---

- Tested adding custom toml file succesfully
- For Default configs, these cannot be set until the user starts the world
- fine tuned property names and validation issues, added min and max to ConfigBase class


7.
---
  - build OreClusterManager Class and determine its role
  - test OreClusterManager for determining cluster location and parameters
  - build OreClusterChunkEditor for handling real time edits to chunks
  - 

8. Add OreClusterCalculator to calculate Chunk positions and values
---

 - Added handling for world seed, subscribing to server start event
 - Ore cluster chunks will be normally distributed according to their spawn rate
and their Standard deviation is determined by {mean / (log2(mean) * 2)}
 - RealTimeConfig keeps track of WORLD_SPAWN
 - NOTE validate STD_DIST formula for error values
 - Added HolyBucketsUtility class for static utility methods like chunk distances and ids
 - NOTE validate min/max chunk dist formulas on startup


9. Simple commit
---

	- Cleaned up validation functions

13.
---

	- Realized that OreClusterManger needs to be an instance class in order to support multiple worlds, will address later
	- Added thread support to OreClusterManager
	- Need to resolve difficult issue with overlapping ore areas

14.
---

	- Address "getBatchedChunkList" not producing correct amount of chunkIds
	- 

15.
---
	- Added logId to all printable console log building statements
	- Added logId and classId values to all logging statements in actionable classes
	- fixed bug in MangedChunk.java that failed to check for null value when combining maps

16.
---
	- Ensure chunk generation works outside of 256x256 area
	- Ensure we can write chunk data to file
	- write chunk data to file based on world name
	- write chunk data to file based on dimension
	-

17.
---

Dependencies are always an issue:

// Add runtime dependencies to jar
jarJar.fromRuntimeConfiguration()

jarJar {
    // Include or exclude dependencies here from runtime configuration
    dependencies {
        include(dependency("org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc:3.46.1.0"))
    }
}

18.
---

	- Test if chunkloading works in the nether		X Works
	- Test if chunkloading works in the end			X Works
	- Add lastBlockChecked field to ManagedOreClusterChunk - NO, we can just keep it in RAM and re-clean it if it exceeds max time
	- Added special exclude HashSets to loggerbase to deal with logging message overflow

19.
---

	- handleChunkCleaning checks every block and adds potential cluster blocks to a map
	- added workerThreadCleanClusters that cleans determined clusters
	- Need to set reference to ManagedOreChunkCluster in ManagedChunk after determining the cluster


20.
---

	- Test code still compiles
        - Convert Section Pos to correct world pos for block state replacement
        - Convert replacement blocks to actual blocks
        - Check error handling if block state setting fails


21.

		- create not terrible JSON defaultConfig for multiple ores
		- test config works for different ores with different configurations
		- perform speed and accuracy chunk building test by flying with elytra


		- file read in/out JSON method should be generalized and moved to foundations
		- returns List<String>
		- takes default to use as backup
		- should default be written out
		- naming convention for errors
		- prefix for errors
		- CLASS_ID for errors
		- Configure a JSON object for this purpose

		- SERVER_DIRECTORY == .
		- user.dir == \run directory

		- port mod to remote server and test for accuracy and ability
		- find out how to get chunkUnload to trigger

		- write chunkBuildingAlgorithm, just build a big cube
		- Will need to load adjacent chunks when building cluster to feel natural
		- Or just add them to the other cchunks queue, that may be tough

		- Determine "ticksLastRefreshed" parameter on ManagedOreClusterChunk
		- tickLastRefreshed < LAST_REGEN_TICK then do a refresh, set tickLastRefreshed to LAST_REGEN_TICK
		- when currentGameTick > NEXT_REGEN_TICK, set LAST_REGEN_TICK == NEXT_REGEN_TICK
			- calculate NEXT_REGEN_TICK += PERIOD_LENGTH_TICKS

	      - Find way to check if chunk gets unloaded
		-  THREADS CONTINUE TO RUN AFTER WORLD IS SHUTDOWN, NEEDS TO QUIT
