Implementation of COreClusters.java:

1. The COreClusters class extends ConfigBase to utilize its configuration management capabilities.

2. Main configuration options are defined as class fields using the appropriate config types (ConfigInt, ConfigFloat) from the ConfigBase class.

3. Each configuration option is initialized in the constructor using the corresponding method (i for integer, f for float) from ConfigBase.

4. The default values, ranges, and descriptions are set according to the provided oreClusters.yaml file.

5. An inner class OreClusterConfig is created to handle specific ore type configurations.

6. The OreClusterConfig class contains fields for ore-specific configurations, initialized with the parent COreClusters values as defaults.

7. A List<OreClusterConfig> is maintained to store configurations for different ore types.

8. An addOreCluster method is provided to add new ore type configurations to the list.

9. The getName method is overridden to return "OreClusters" as the configuration name.

This implementation allows for a flexible configuration system where global settings can be defined and then overridden for specific ore types as needed. The use of ConfigBase provides a consistent way to manage and access these configurations throughout the mod.
